# MYSHAPE PROTOCOL
### The Sovereign 3D Identity Layer for the Decentralized Human.

---

## 🌐 The Protocol Vision
MyShape is defining the next evolution of human representation. We replace rigid, platform-locked 2D fragments with a fluid, decentralized 3D identity layer.

- **Ethereal Data Energy**: Moving beyond biological constraints into a data-stream-composed existence [cite: 2026-01-10].
- **Wireframe Anatomy**: Utilizing a purely transparent human outline to represent the core essence of the decentralized human [cite: 2026-01-10].
- **Non-Binary Aesthetic**: A visual identity that transcends traditional gender boundaries, focused on pure data and energy [cite: 2026-01-10].
